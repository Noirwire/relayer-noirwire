 * The reference SOL price, read from Pyth's SOL/USD price account through the same RPC.
 *
 * It is independent of Jupiter: the account is written by Pyth's receiver program, which
 * only accepts a price carrying the Wormhole guardians' signatures. So a quote that is wrong,
 * or a Jupiter that is wrong as a whole, shows up against it. What it is not: proof of the
 * price. An RPC that lies about one account can lie about this one, which is why the
 * operator's own MAX_USDC_PER_SOL bound exists and is checked separately.
 *
 * It is a USD price and the swap pays USDC; the two are treated as equal.
